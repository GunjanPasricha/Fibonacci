# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

## Overview

The Fibonacci Sequence Generator is a Python script that calculates the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GunjanPasricha/Fibonacci-sequence.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fibonacci-sequence
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python fibonacci.py
   ```

4. Enter the value of `n` when prompted, and the script will calculate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Example

```python
result = fibonacci(6)
print(result)
```

This will output the 6th term of the Fibonacci sequence.
